TASK: Build a complete, production-ready, SEO-optimized website of online calculators that replicates and improves upon calculator.net. Include every calculator in the list below (all categories). The site must be modern, mobile-first, extremely fast, modular, and ready to scale to hundreds more calculators. Create a generator system so each calculator page is produced from a single JSON/CSV data file. Implement the Trust & Clarity color scheme and UX rules described below.

GOALS:
- Ship a scaffolding site with one codebase that auto-generates pages for every calculator in the provided list.
- Every calculator page must include: working calculator UI, SEO-rich explanation content, formula, manual example, FAQ section, related calculators, JSON-LD schema for FAQ and HowTo (where applicable), and embed widget code.
- Produce a sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and accessible navigation.
- Optimize for speed (minimal JS, lazy load, semantic HTML). Follow WCAG contrast guidance.

TECH STACK:
- Static-first architecture: HTML + CSS + vanilla JS for core (no heavy frameworks required).
- Use a simple build script (Node.js) that reads a `calculators.json` and emits per-calculator HTML files (or optional: a lightweight Express/Flask dev server for demo).
- CSS: single `styles.css` with CSS variables (root tokens) for colors and theme + optional Tailwind config generator file.
- JS: `script.js` for search, embed generator, related calculators, dark mode toggle, and small calculation library per calculator.
- Folder structure:
  - `/src`
    - `index.html`
    - `sitemap.html`
    - `categories/` (category landing pages)
    - `calculators/` (auto-generated pages)
    - `assets/` (icons, logo, fonts)
    - `styles.css`
    - `script.js`
    - `generators/` (node script: `build.js` or `generate.js`)
    - `calculators.json` (master list — each entry includes name, slug, category, inputs, formula, description, examples, FAQ array, related slugs)
  - `/dist` output after build

COLOR SCHEME (Trust & Clarity — required exactly)
- Root CSS variables to include:
  --bg: #F5FBFF;
  --surface: #FFFFFF;
  --text: #0B1224;
  --muted: #6B7280;
  --brand: #1E88E5;
  --brand-600: #1565C0;
  --accent: #00A3A3;
  --border: #E6F0FA;
- Use these variables everywhere. Add button / focus / hover states as described:
  - `.button { background: var(--brand); color: #fff; border-radius: 10px; transition: transform .14s ease, filter .14s ease }`
  - `.button:hover { transform: translateY(-1px); filter: brightness(.94); }`

SITE & NAVIGATION:
- Header: Logo + search input + nav links (Home / Categories / Sitemap / About / Contact / Embed).
- Hero: brief tagline (“Free Online Calculators for Every Need”) + search.
- Categories on homepage: Financial, Fitness & Health, Math, Other, Calculators for Your Site.
- Breadcrumbs on every calculator page.
- Footer: sitemap links, privacy, terms, contact, last-updated date.
- Add a `sitemap.xml` generator in build script.

SEO & CONTENT RULES (MANDATORY):
- Every calculator page must include:
  1. `title` formatted: `<Calculator Name> — Free Online Calculator | YourSiteName`
  2. meta description (approx 140–160 chars) derived from the short description in JSON.
  3. H1 = calculator name; H2 for “How it works”, H3 for “Formula”, H3 for “Example”, H2 for “FAQ”.
  4. A concise but thorough explanation paragraph (40–120 words) describing use cases and value.
  5. The exact formula, with math rendered as inline HTML or MathML where appropriate.
  6. A *manual example* showing how to compute the sample numbers step-by-step.
  7. Minimum 5-7 FAQ entries for each calculator (authoritatively written).
  8. Include JSON-LD FAQ schema and If applicable, HowTo schema with step items.
  9. “Related Calculators” box (4 items) linking to other slugs.
 10. Add internal links strategically to related pages to build topical authority.
- Provide `lastUpdated` metadata and display it near the top.
- Generate `robots.txt` that allows indexing and points to sitemap.
- Ensure semantic markup (article, header, main, nav, footer, section, aside).

AUTOMATION: GENERATOR / DATA-DRIVEN PAGES
- Create `calculators.json` array. Each entry should include:
  - `name`, `slug`, `category`, `short_description`, `long_description`, `inputs` (array: {name, id, type, placeholder, unit, default}), `outputs` (array), `formula_html`, `calculation_js` (string: function body), `examples` (array of {inputs, explanation}), `faqs` (array of {q, a}), `related` (array of slugs)
- The build script should:
  - Read the JSON.
  - For each item, generate an HTML page `calculators/<slug>.html` using a template partial that inserts SEO content and wires up calculator JS.
  - Add the page link to sitemap.xml and sitemap.html.
  - Validate output (no missing fields).
- Provide a seed `calculators.json` that includes every calculator from the full list provided (see list below). For each calculator seed entry include minimal fields (short_description, example, 5 FAQs) — the generator should produce full pages; filler text may be used but flagged as TODO for human review.

- Right column: Results card with summary, explanation of results, CTA to related calculators.
- Under both columns: SEO content block containing long_description, formula, example calculation, and FAQ accordion.
- Provide a compact “print” view optimized for embedding.
- Provide an “Embed this calculator” button which opens a modal with a snippet:
  `<iframe src="https://yoursite.com/calculators/<slug>.html?embed=true" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>`
- Make inputs URL-serializable so example links can be shared and prefill inputs from query params.

INTERACTIVITY & FEATURES:
- Search that filters calculators by name & category (client-side).
- Lightweight router (optional) to allow deep linking without full page reloads.
- Copy-to-clipboard for results & embed code.
- Dark mode toggle (optional) using CSS variables.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, aria-* attributes for form controls and accordion.

PERFORMANCE:
- Lazy load any 3rd-party scripts.
- Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold.
- Minify assets and provide a build command (`npm run build`) that produces `/dist`.

DOCUMENTATION & OUTPUT:
- README.md that explains how to run dev server, build, add new calculators via `calculators.json`, and how to update content.
- Provide a `content-review.md` file listing which calculators still have placeholder content and need expert review (e.g., tax laws, medical disclaimers).
- Output: full site files in `/dist` and `calculators.json` seeded with all calculators above (basic content created automatically).

DELIVERABLES:
1. Fully generated static site in `/dist` with one working example per category (but generator must scaffold every calculator page).
2. Full `calculators.json` with every calculator slug present (content may be partially auto-generated — flag pages requiring expert review).
3. Build script `generators/build.js` that creates HTML pages, sitemap.xml, and updates sitemap.html.
4. styles.css with theme variables and component styles.
5. script.js handling calculator logic wiring, search, and embed features.
6. README with instructions and expansion guidelines.

PRIORITY SEQUENCING (how to output on first run):
- Phase 1 (deliver immediately): Homepage, sitemap, categories, build script, styles, script, calculators.json (with entries for ALL calculators), and fully-built pages for these 4 starter calculators: BMI Calculator, Mortgage Calculator, Percentage Calculator, Scientific Calculator (as canonical examples).
- Phase 2 (on same run): Use build script to generate placeholder pages for the remaining calculators with autogenerated SEO blocks and FAQs (mark those items in `content-review.md`).
- All pages must be linkable and included in sitemap.xml.

EXTRA NOTES FOR THE DEVELOPER BOT:
- Use the color scheme exactly as above.
- For tax or health calculators, include a small disclaimer and encourage users to consult professionals — and flag those pages in the `content-review.md`.
- Keep the UI modern: use large, readable inputs, clear CTAs, whitespace, and microinteractions.
- Provide sample unit tests / sanity checks in the generator for 10 random calculators to confirm outputs match expected examples (optional but preferred).

END RESULT:
A modular, SEO-first, production-ready site scaffold that contains entries/pages for every calculator in the provided list, uses Trust & Clarity color tokens, includes embed widgets, sitemap.xml, JSON-LD schemas, and a build script so I can iterate fast.
