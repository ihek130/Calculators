Current state: Most target calculators are placeholder functions that return `null` or have minimal implementation.

### Target Calculators to Implement (Edit existing files):
1. **CollegeCostCalculatorComponent.tsx** - Calculate total college education costs with inflation
2. **SimpleInterestCalculatorComponent.tsx** - Basic interest calculations for loans/investments  
3. **CdCalculatorComponent.tsx** - Certificate of Deposit growth and maturity calculations

5. **RothIraCalculatorComponent.tsx** - Tax-free retirement growth projections
6. **IraCalculatorComponent.tsx** - Traditional IRA contribution and withdrawal planning
7. **RmdCalculatorComponent.tsx** - Required Minimum Distribution calculations
8. **VatCalculatorComponent.tsx** - Value Added Tax calculations for international users
9. **CashBackOrLowInterestCalculatorComponent.tsx** - Credit card rewards optimization
10. **AutoLeaseCalculatorComponent.tsx** - Vehicle leasing vs buying analysis

**Action Required**: Replace the placeholder `const XxxCalculatorComponent = () => null;` with full implementations.

## üìã CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### 1. **EXACT FORMULAS** (High Priority)
- Use **identical formulas** to calculator.net for accuracy
- Research industry-standard financial calculations
